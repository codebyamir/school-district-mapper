# School District Locator

The School District Locator is a Python tool designed to map any given street address in the United States to its corresponding school district.

## Features

- Address to school district mapping
- Utilizes U.S. Census Bureau Geocoding Services for precise address location
- Spatial analysis with GeoPandas for accurate district identification
- Supports Shapefile boundary file format
